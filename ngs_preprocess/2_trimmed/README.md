## Directory where trimmed FASTQ files are stored after processing with FastP or other tools. 
Also there are some other files:
- A text file named paired_fastq.list that contains the file names with full path that will be trimmed by fastP.
- A text file named missing_pairs.log that contains the samples that are missing their pair (R1 or R2) and thus will not be processed.
- The output of FatsP trimming statistics
